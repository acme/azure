      my $blobservice = Net::Azure::BlobService->new(
          primary_access_key => $primary_access_key );

      # Get Blob Service Properties
      my $uri = URI->new("https://$account.blob.core.windows.net/");
      $uri->query_form( [ restype => 'service', comp => 'properties' ] );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides access to the REST interface to Windows Azure
    Platform Blob Service for storing text and binary data:

      http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dd135733.aspx

    You must sign up to a storage account and obtain a primary access key.
    Create an HTTP request as per the page above and this module can sign
    the request, make the request and return an HTTP::Response object.

    This module intentionally does not interpret the response, but typically
    it will have content type of 'application/xml' which you can parse with
    your favourite XML parser.

METHODS
  make_http_request
    Sign and make an HTTP request:

      my $response = $blobservice->make_http_request($request);

  sign_http_request
    Sign an HTTP request:

      my $signed_request = $blobservice->sign_http_request($request);
